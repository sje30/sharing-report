# orcids

[AU: While we have added ORCIDs for all authors as requested, we would
be grateful if authors Marwick, Halchenko, Hanke, Sufi, Abrams,
Wachtler, Willshaw and Pouzal could also link their ORCIDs to our
manuscript tracking system (MTS) for future reference.]

TODO.

# Acronyms

[AU: Should the last one here be “Brian” or “Brain?” Please provide
URLs for acronyms in both lists or spell them out.].

Brian is correct.

The acronyms are as follows:

SPM - Statistical Parametric Mapping
FSL - FMRIB Software Library (where FMRIB = Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain!)
AFNI - Analysis of Functional NeuroImages
NEST - NEural Simulation Tool

# Ref9/10
[AU: Please clarify which reference the quotation is from.]
