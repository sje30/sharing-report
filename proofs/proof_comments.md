# orcids

[AU: While we have added ORCIDs for all authors as requested, we would
be grateful if authors Marwick, Halchenko, Hanke, Sufi, Abrams,
Wachtler, Willshaw and Pouzal could also link their ORCIDs to our
manuscript tracking system (MTS) for future reference.]

# Acronyms

[AU: Should the last one here be “Brian” or “Brain?” Please provide
URLs for acronyms in both lists or spell them out.].

Brian is correct.

The acronyms are as follows:

SPM - Statistical Parametric Mapping
FSL - FMRIB Software Library (where FMRIB = Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain!)
AFNI - Analysis of Functional NeuroImages
NEST - NEural Simulation Tool

# Ref 9/10
[AU: Please clarify which reference the quotation is from.]

TODO
http://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/1.1822162 is reference 9


Reference 10 has the following text:

Recall Claerbout’s claim “an article about a computational result is
advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full
software environment, code and data, that produced the result.” Those
who are sticklers for linguistic accuracy will  nd that “scholarship”
is not really appropriate in this quotation. A better choice would
have been “knowledge.” Computational reproducibility is the means by
which the published “knowledge” becomes really available to a
widespread audience.

So perhaps we should change the sentence to:

    As advocated by Claerbout[ref 9] and Donoho[ref 10], for
    computational sciences the scholarship is not the article; the
    "scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that
    produced the result."[10]

# TOP

[AU: Definition correct as added? Or spell out TOP.] 

correct.

# Data URLs
[AU: URL correct as edited?]
The https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories is ok.
However, the preceding URL for PLOS, does not resolve:

http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability%23loc-recommended-repositories

changing %23 to # (which should not matter) makes the URL okay:

http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories

# Closing paragraph

Edits in final paragraph are okay.

# Acknowledements

"Cambridge, UK" was location of workshop.

# Reference 23

[AU: Please check this reference and confirm it is correct. If possible,
provide a DOI.]

The reference is correct.  I cannot find a DOI for it, but the
following is a URL to the author's copy:

http://web.stanford.edu/~vcs/papers/ijclp-STODDEN-2009.pdf

# General

All URLs, except the PLOS one, resolve okay.
