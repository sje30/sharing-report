# orcids

[AU: While we have added ORCIDs for all authors as requested, we would
be grateful if authors Marwick, Halchenko, Hanke, Sufi, Abrams,
Wachtler, Willshaw and Pouzal could also link their ORCIDs to our
manuscript tracking system (MTS) for future reference.]

TODO.

# Acronyms

URLs for acronyms in both lists or spell them out.].

Brian is correct.

The acronyms are as follows:

SPM - Statistical Parametric Mapping
FSL - FMRIB Software Library (where FMRIB = Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain!)
AFNI - Analysis of Functional NeuroImages
NEST - NEural Simulation Tool

correct.

# Data URLs
[AU: URL correct as edited?]
The https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories is ok.
However, the preceding URL for PLOS, does not resolve:

http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability%23loc-recommended-repositories

changing %23 to # (which should not matter) makes the URL okay:

http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories

# Closing paragraph

Edits in final paragraph are okay.

# Acknowledements

"Cambridge, UK" was location of workshop.

# Reference 23

[AU: Please check this reference and confirm it is correct. If possible,
provide a DOI.]

The reference is correct.  I cannot find a DOI for it, but the
following is a URL to the author's copy:

http://web.stanford.edu/~vcs/papers/ijclp-STODDEN-2009.pdf

# General

All URLs, except the PLOS one, resolve okay.
