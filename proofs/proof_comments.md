# ORCIDs

[AU: While we have added ORCIDs for all authors as requested, we would
be grateful if authors Marwick, Halchenko, Hanke, Sufi, Abrams,
Wachtler, Willshaw and Pouzal could also link their ORCIDs to our
manuscript tracking system (MTS) for future reference.]

We will ask our authors to do this.

# Acronyms

[AU: Should the last one here be “Brian” or “Brain?” Please provide
URLs for acronyms in both lists or spell them out.].

Brian is correct.

The acronyms are as follows:


SPM: Statistical Parametric Mapping

FSL: FMRIB Software Library (where FMRIB = Oxford Centre for
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain!)

AFNI: Analysis of Functional NeuroImages
NEST: NEural Simulation Tool

NEURON is not an acronym.

# Ref 9/10
[AU: Please clarify which reference the quotation is from.]

Please can we change the sentence to clarify the attribution to read:

    As advocated by Claerbout[ref 9] and Donoho[ref 10], for
    computational sciences the scholarship is not the article; the
    "scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that
    produced the result."[ref 10]

# Box 2

[AU: Box 2 is not cited in the text. Please add a citation after the citation of Box 1.]

Add the following text at the location of this query:

    Box 2 describes several online communities for discussing issues
    around code sharing.

# TOP

[AU: Definition correct as added? Or spell out TOP.] 

correct.

# Data URLs
[AU: URL correct as edited?]
The https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories is ok.
However, the preceding URL for PLOS, does not resolve:

http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability%23loc-recommended-repositories

changing %23 to # (which should not matter) makes the URL okay:

http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories

# Closing paragraph

Edits in final paragraph are okay.

# Acknowledements

"Cambridge, UK" was location of workshop.

# Reference 23

[AU: Please check this reference and confirm it is correct. If possible,
provide a DOI.]

The reference is correct, but there is no DOI.  We think the following
might be a better reference for [23] and does have a DOI:

    Stodden, V. Computing in Science & Engineering 11, no. 1: 35-40  (2009). 
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2009.19



# General

All URLs, except the PLOS one, resolve okay.
