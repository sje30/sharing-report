\section*{Background}

Many areas of neuroscience are now critically dependent on
computational tools to help understand the large volumes of data being
created.  Furthermore, computer models are increasingly being used to
help predict and understand the function of the nervous system.  Many
of these computations are complex, and often cannot be concisely
reported in the methods section of a scientific article.  In a few
areas there is some consensus as to software packages for analysis
(e.g. SPM in neuroimaging).  However, computer programs are often
written to solve specific problems.  As authors, how best can we
maximise the chances that other scientists can reproduce our
computations?  Is our research reproducible?

To date, the sharing of computer programs underlying neuroscience
research has been the exception, rather than the rule.  However, there
are many benefits to sharing these programs, including increased
understanding and reuse of your work.  Furthermore, open source programs can be scrutinised and improved, whereas the functioning of closed source
programs remain forever unclear \cite{Vihinen2015}.  Funding agencies, research institutes and publishers are all gradually developing policies to
reduce the withholding of computer programes relating to research
\cite{Morin2012-65e}.  The Nature family of journals have recently
published opinion pieces in favour of sharing whatever code is
available, in whatever form \cite{Barnes2010-iv,Ince2012-225}.  More
recently, since October 2014, all Nature journals require papers to
include a statement declaring \textit{if} the programs underlying central
results in a paper are available. In April 2015 \textit{Nature Biotechnology} offered recommendations for providing code with papers and began asking referees to give feedback on their ability to test code that 
accompanies submitted manuscripts (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n4/full/nbt.3202.html).

\subsection*{Current position}

To help the editors of \textit{Nature Neuroscience} and
\textit{Scientific Data} to evaluate if appropriate code is being
shared, we are now helping to run a one-year trial by adding a small
extra step to the manuscript review process.  During review, a
computational expert will be asked to check what code has been
provided, and to write a brief report commenting on its quality
according to criteria outlined below (``Simple steps to help you share
your code'').  There is no expectation that the expert will re-run the
programs, as often this can take days to recreate the computational
environment, and computations could take many months to complete.
Furthermore, this report will not prevent publication of a manuscript, as the current policy at Nature is not mandatory.


\subsection*{What should be shared?}

Authors may be unclear as to what exactly should be shared.  Ideally,
you should share as much code and data to allow others to reproduce
your work.  However, this may not be possible/practical.  However, it
is expected that you will share key parts of the work, e.g. implementations of novel algorithms or analysis.  By getting into the habit of sharing as much as possible, not only do you help others who wish to reproduce your work, you will be helping other members of your laboratory, or even yourself in 6--12 months time.  By sharing your code publicly, you will know where to find it in the future, rather than the code disappearing on a colleague's laptop when they leave your group.

\subsection*{Simple steps to help you share your code}

Once you have decided \textit{what} you plan to share, here are some simple
guidelines for \textit{how} to share your work.  Note that in many cases these
principles should be followed throughout the lifetime of your project,
not just at the end when you wish to publish your results.

\begin{description}
\item [Version control] Use a version control system (such as Git) to
  develop the code.  The version control database can then be easily and freely
  shared with others using sites such as \url{http://github.com} \cite{Ram2013}.

\item [Persistent URLs] Generate stable URLs (such as a DOI) for key
  versions of your software.  This can be done freely and routinely with sites
  such as \url{http://zenodo.org}.  If your work includes computer
  models of neural systems, you may wish to consider depositing these
  models in established repositories such as ModelDB
  (\url{https://senselab.med.yale.edu/}) or
  \url{http://opensourcebrain.org}.

\item [License] Choose a suitable license for your code to assert how you wish others to reuse your code  For example, to maximise reuse, you may wish to use a permissive license such as MIT or BSD \cite{Stodden2009}.  Licenses are also important to protect you from damage others might suffer from your code. See  \url{http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/adopting-open-source-licence}  for a guide to licenses.

\item [Etiquette] When working code written by others, observe Daniel Kahneman's \cite{Kahneman2014} 'reproducibility etiquette' and have a discussion with the authors of the code to give them a chance to fix bugs or respond to issues you've identified before you make any public statements.

\item [Documentation] Contrary to popular expectations, you do not
  need to write extensive documentation or a user's guide for the code
  still be to useful to others \cite{Barnes2010-iv}.  However, it is
  worth providing a minimal README file to give an introduction to
  what the code does, and how to run it.  For example, provide
  instructions on how to regenerate a key result, or a particular
  figure from a paper. Literate programming methods, where code and narrative text are interwoven in the same document, make documentation semi-automatic and can save a lot of time. 

\item [Tools and case studies] Consider using modern, widely used tools that can help with making your computational research reproducible.  Many of
  these tools have already been used in Neuroscience and serve as good
  examples to follow, for example Org mode \cite{Delescluse2011},
  IPython \cite{Stevens2013} and Knitr \cite{Eglen2014}.  Other
  prominent examples of reproducible research in Computational
  Neuroscience include \cite{Vogels2011-c8c,Waskom2014-gd}.
  Virtualisation environments, such as Docker, can also be used to
  encapsulate or preserve all of the computational environment so that
  other users can run your code without problems with incompatible or missing dependencies \cite{Boettiger2015}.

\textit{Should we point to an online forum where people can ask
  questions to a community to get help with issues surrounding code
  sharing?  What would be a good one?  Or should we create a
  github.com organisation and allow people to post questions as
  ``issues''?}


\subsection*{Closing remarks}

We will endeavor to lead by example, and follow all these practices as
part of our future work in all scientific publications.  (Possible
link to a bigger topic on JB re the "Research Manifesto").
\textbf{JB: want to expand at all on this point?}
