  abstract    = "Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory
                 mechanisms that can be affected by activity. We present a
                 model of a stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuron in which
                 several Ca2+-dependent pathways are used to regulate the
                 maximal conductances of membrane currents in an
                 activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this
                 type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances
                 by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven
                 voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca2+
                 sensors acting on different time scales. Starting from random
                 initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the
                 maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to
                 values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity
                 approximately 90\% of the time. In these models, the same
                 pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of
                 maximal conductances, and this range is compared with
                 voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG.
                 If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed,
                 the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original
                 pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the
                 activity pattern is again restored after a transient
                 adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to
                 their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may
                 regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of
                 electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances,
                 and that the regulation process requires feedback systems
                 capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a
                 number of different time scales.",

	abstract = {In computational science, reproducibility requires that researchers make code and data available to others so that the data can be analyzed in a similar manner as in the original publication. Code must be available to be distributed, data must be accessible in a readable format, and a platform must be available for widely distributing the data and code. In addition, both data and code need to be licensed permissively enough so that others can reproduce the work without a substantial legal burden.

Implementing Reproducible Research covers many of the elements necessary for conducting and distributing reproducible research. It explains how to accurately reproduce a scientific result.

Divided into three parts, the book discusses the tools, practices, and dissemination platforms for ensuring reproducibility in computational science. It describes:

    Computational tools, such as Sweave, knitr, {VisTrails}, Sumatra, {CDE}, and the Declaratron system
    Open source practices, good programming practices, trends in open science, and the role of cloud computing in reproducible research
    Software and methodological platforms, including open source software packages, {RunMyCode} platform, and open access journals

Each part presents contributions from leaders who have developed software and other products that have advanced the field. Supplementary material is available at www.{ImplementingRR}.org.},

                 has become an issue of increasing importance to computer
                 systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though
                 computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than
                 replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly
                 changing nature of computer environments makes being able to
                 reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this
                 paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one
                 research project cannot be successfully executed or extended
                 by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to
                 these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems,
                 and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging
                 technology Docker combines several areas from systems research
                 - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform
                 portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a
                 `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate
                 this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R

                 aligned with internal goals and is thus central to
                 intelligent, purposeful behavior. Control is thought to depend
                 in part on the active representation of task information in
                 prefrontal cortex (PFC), which provides a source of contextual
                 bias on perception, decision making, and action. In the
                 present study, we investigated the organization, influences,
                 and consequences of context representation as human subjects
                 performed a cued sorting task that required them to flexibly
                 judge the relationship between pairs of multivalent stimuli.
                 Using a connectivity-based parcellation of PFC and
                 multivariate decoding analyses, we determined that context is
                 specifically and transiently represented in a region spanning
                 the inferior frontal sulcus during context-dependent decision
                 making. We also found strong evidence that decision context is
                 represented within the intraparietal sulcus, an area
                 previously shown to be functionally networked with the
                 inferior frontal sulcus at rest and during task performance.
                 Rule-guided allocation of attention to different stimulus
                 dimensions produced discriminable patterns of activation in
                 visual cortex, providing a signature of top-down bias over
                 perception. Furthermore, demands on cognitive control arising
                 from the task structure modulated context representation,
                 which was found to be strongest after a shift in task rules.
                 When context representation in frontoparietal areas increased
                 in strength, as measured by the discriminability of
                 high-dimensional activation patterns, the bias on attended
                 stimulus features was enhanced. These results provide novel
                 evidence that illuminates the mechanisms by which humans
                 flexibly guide behavior in complex environments.",

                 with IPython Notebook to provide a flexible, lightweight, and
                 agile workflow for fully reproducible scientific research.
                 This informal and pragmatic approach uses IPython Notebook to
                 capture the steps in a scientific computation as it is
                 gradually automated and made ready for publication, without
                 mandating the use of any separate application that can
                 constrain scientific exploration and innovation. The resulting
                 notebook concisely records each step involved in even very
                 complex computational processes that led to a particular
                 figure or numerical result, allowing the complete chain of
                 events to be replicated automatically. Lancet was originally
                 designed to help solve problems in computational neuroscience,
                 such as analyzing the sensitivity of a complex simulation to
                 various parameters, or collecting the results from multiple
                 runs with different random starting points. However, because
                 it is never possible to know in advance what tools might be
                 required in future tasks, Lancet has been designed to be
                 completely general, supporting any type of program as long as
                 it can be launched as a process and can return output in the
                 form of files. For instance, Lancet is also heavily used by
                 one of the authors in a separate research group for launching
                 batches of microprocessor simulations. This general design

  abstract    = "Reproducible data analysis is an approach aiming at
                 complementing classical printed scientific articles with
                 everything required to independently reproduce the results
                 they present. ``Everything'' covers here: the data, the
                 computer codes and a precise description of how the code was
                 applied to the data. A brief history of this approach is
                 presented first, starting with what economists have been
                 calling replication since the early eighties to end with what
                 is now called reproducible research in computational data
                 analysis oriented fields like statistics and signal
                 processing. Since efficient tools are instrumental for a
                 routine implementation of these approaches, a description of
                 some of the available ones is presented next. A toy example
                 demonstrates then the use of two open source software programs
                 for reproducible data analysis: the ``Sweave family'' and the
                 org-mode of emacs. The former is bound to R while the latter
                 can be used with R, Matlab, Python and many more
                 ``generalist'' data processing software. Both solutions can be
                 used with Unix-like, Windows and Mac families of operating
                 systems. It is argued that neuroscientists could communicate
                 much more efficiently their results by adopting the
                 reproducible research paradigm from their lab books all the
                 way to their articles, thesis and books.",

  abstract    = "Cortical neurons receive balanced excitatory and inhibitory
                 synaptic currents. Such a balance could be established and
                 maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic
                 plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism
                 provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns
                 observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a
                 recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory
                 receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory
                 plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a
                 homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular
                 network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories
                 with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the
                 background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli.
                 Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity
                 in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical
                 circuitry.",

  abstract    = "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
                 has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
                 thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI
                 and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the
                 non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is
                 routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there
                 has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and
                 describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This
                 renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs)
                 difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the
                 application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance
                 protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain
                 Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and
                 describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats
                 compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of
                 practices already common in the field, and captures the
                 metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.",
